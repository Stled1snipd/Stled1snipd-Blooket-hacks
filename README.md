Giving all credit to Gsnipe1blookethacks he made these codes I just made a few slight modifications to the code, and dont think I made this because I 
didn't. I just made it so that when you go to the github button it goes to my github and I made the "Developed by Gsnipe1blookethacks thanks soo much
for using the code."go away, which in my oppinion is faster and more efficent. And thank you to Gsnipe1blookethacks for making the code!! 
(I am not using these codes as they are mine) (I DID NOT MAKE THIS CODES!!)
